## Project Description

When docker is initiated the Users table is seeded with 1 user and 1 category.
Product table will use category relation but at the moment user relation will not be added.
Implementing user login flow only for relation purposes is not considered part of the core functionality
so at the moment it will stay just as a simple schema.


## Project Setup
1. Open project directory and run following command:
`docker compose up --build`
2. Open postman and import collection located in the project directory
`testing.postman_collection.json`
3. Use the saved endpoints to test functionality
